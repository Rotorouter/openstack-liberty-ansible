# openstack-liberty-ansible
A collection of Ansible playbooks and supporting files to build Openstack Liberty. I developed it by hand from scratch as an Ansible learning exercise. The playbooks are written for Ansible 2.2 and all of the hosts being controlled are Ubuntu 16.04. Any exceptions to the "developed from scratch" rule are noted in the relevant playbook.
